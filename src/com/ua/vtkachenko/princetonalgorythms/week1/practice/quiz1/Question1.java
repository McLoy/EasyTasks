/*
Social network connectivity. Given a social network containing n members and a log file
containing m timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an
algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every
member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is
sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of
your algorithm should be mlogn or better and use extra space proportional to n.

Note: these interview questions are ungraded and purely for your own enrichment. To get a hint, submit a solution.
